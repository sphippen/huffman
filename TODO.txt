- Add some way to report out of the decoder EOF is hit
- Prevent overflow when calculating bits left by restricting buffer size (including at input)
- Enforce that more data can't be added after the EOF in the encoder
- More typedefs for internal types
- Prevent overflow in EncoderByteCount by restricting internal buffer size to < (INT_MAX - 256*sizeof(ctr))
- Audit the whole thing
