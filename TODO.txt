- Make sure serialized count values aren't negative
- Add some way to report out of the decoder EOF is hit
- Enforce that more data can't be added after the EOF in the encoder
- Enforce that more data can't be processed after EOF is hit in the decoder
- More typedefs for internal types
- Comments
? Prevent overflow in EncoderByteCount by restricting internal buffer size to < (INT_MAX - 256*sizeof(ctr))
? Prevent overflow in DecoderByteCount by restricting internal buffer size to < (INT_MAX - 256*sizeof(ctr))
- Audit the whole thing
- Make asserts more consistent

- Test in circumstances where malloc can actually fail (to make sure that the code behaves properly in those cases)
