Huffman

An inefficient C implementation of Huffman coding.
One day I wondered if I could still remember how Huffman coding worked since implementing it a long time ago in a data structures course.
I then answered this question by spending all of my free time over the course of a few days writing this code.
Turns out, I can.
But it's not very fast or useful.
Oh well.
